# Overview

## What is Docusaurus?

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is an open-source tool that helps developers build **documentation websites**.  
Instead of setting up a custom site from scratch, you write your content in **Markdown** and Docusaurus turns it into a fast, organized static website.  

Why developers like it:  

- ✍️ Write docs in Markdown/MDX (no special skills required).  
- 🔌 Built-in support for versioning, search, and plugins.  
- ⚡ Generates a **static site** that’s fast, secure, and easy to host.  

Think of it as a framework that handles the website part, so you can focus on writing great docs.

- 🚀 **Detects Docusaurus automatically** — no extra setup.  
- 🔄 **Connects directly to GitHub** — every push creates a new deployment.  
- 👀 **Preview links** for pull requests — test changes before they go live.  
- 🌍 **Global CDN** — your docs load quickly for users everywhere.  

This lessens the burden of manual deployments and makes your docs workflow smoother.
