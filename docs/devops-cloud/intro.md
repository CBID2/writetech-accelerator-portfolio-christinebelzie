## ðŸŒ± What I Learned

- **Define your audience first.** Once I knew I was writing for developers new to Docusaurus/Vercel, deciding what to explain became straightforward.

- **Good documentation structure is strategic, not just organized.** Each section (setup, step-by-step, troubleshooting, summary) serves a purpose so users can jump to what they need.

- **Testing your deployment process yourself is essential.** Following my own instructions from scratch caught missing steps and unclear explanations I wouldn't have noticed otherwise.
