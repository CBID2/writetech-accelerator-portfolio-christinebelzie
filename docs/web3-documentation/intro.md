# Web3 Documentation Project

This project is part of the WriteTech Accelerator Programme and explores technical writing in the Web3 ecosystem. I chose to create an improved version of Lens user guide

## Reasoning

I chose this to gain more experience in writing content for Web3 Apps 

##  Files Included

| File            | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| user-guide.md   | End-user guide for a Web3 tool or dApp |
| reflection.txt  | (Optional) Notes on what I learned or challenges I faced |
