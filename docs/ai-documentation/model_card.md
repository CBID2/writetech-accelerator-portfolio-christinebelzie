# ChatGPT Model Card

This model card provides a clear overview of ChatGPT GPT-4 model. It is designed for beginners, developers, and researchers to understand the model’s features, intended uses, limitations, and safety considerations. This helps users make informed decisions and use GPT-4 responsibly.  

---

## 1. Basic Details

- **Model Name:** GPT-4 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4)  
- **Version:** Initial release (March 2023)  
- **Developer:** OpenAI  
- **License:** Proprietary (API and ChatGPT access)  
- **Updates:** Includes GPT-4 Turbo (Nov 2023), GPT-4o (May 2024), and GPT-4.1 (April 2025)  

---

## 2. Intended Use

- **What it’s for:** Generating text, summarizing content, translating languages, answering questions, reasoning tasks, and processing images.  
- **Good use cases:** Education, research support, coding assistance, creative writing, accessibility tools, and image understanding.  
- **Not recommended for:** Medical or legal advice, high-stakes decisions, or situations needing guaranteed accurate facts.  

---

## 3. How it Works

- **Type:** Transformer-based large language model  
- **Input:** Text (up to 32k tokens), images (for multimodal input)  
- **Output:** Text  
- **Training method:** Predicts the next word in context and is fine-tuned using human feedback (RLHF)  
- **Notes:** Exact model size, dataset details, and compute requirements are not publicly released  

---

## 4. Training & Testing

- **Data sources:** Public text, licensed datasets, and text-image pairs for multimodal capabilities  
- **Testing:** Evaluated using professional exams (bar exam, USMLE), MMLU benchmark, and red-teaming for safety  
- **Results highlights:**  
  - Bar Exam: Top 10% performance  
  - USMLE: 20+ points above passing score  
  - Consistently better than GPT-3.5 on reasoning and language tasks  

---

## 5. Performance

- **Strengths:**  
  - Advanced reasoning and problem-solving  
  - Multilingual capabilities  
  - Coding support  
  - Handles long documents (up to 32k tokens)  
  - Understands text and images  
- **Limitations:**  
  - Can generate incorrect or misleading content (“hallucinations”)  
  - Knowledge is limited to data before September 2021  
  - Performance may vary across different groups or domains  

---

## 6. Safety & Ethics

- **Known risks:** Bias in outputs, potential misuse for disinformation, impersonation, or automation  
- **Mitigation measures:** Human feedback fine-tuning, safety filters, and ongoing monitoring  
- **Limitations:** Not fully transparent or interpretable in all outputs  

---

## 7. Reliability & Privacy

- **Fairness:** Audited for bias, but imperfections remain  
- **Interpretability:** Outputs are not fully understandable  
- **Robustness:** Reliable in trained domains; less stable in new or unusual tasks  
- **Privacy:** Should not be used for sensitive or personal data
