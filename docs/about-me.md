Hi there! I'm a technical writer with a background in software development and a passion for transforming complex technical concepts into clear, user-focused documentation. My unique combination of development experience and writing expertise allows me to bridge the gap between engineering teams and end users, creating documentation that actually gets used.

I believe great documentation isn't just about explaining how something works‚Äîit's about understanding why users need it and guiding them to success with confidence and clarity.

## Core Competencies

**Technical Documentation**
- API references and developer guides
- User manuals and onboarding flows
- Process documentation and knowledge management

**Documentation Tools & Technologies**
- Static site generators (Docusaurus, GitBook, MkDocs)
- Version control and docs-as-code workflows
- Content management systems and collaboration platforms

**Content Strategy**
- Information architecture and content organization
- User journey mapping and documentation audits
- Cross-functional collaboration with engineering and product teams

**Development Foundation**
- Software development background enabling deeper technical understanding
- Experience with developer tools and workflows
- Ability to review and document code-level implementations

<!-- ## Featured Projects

## Beyond Work

When I'm not crafting documentation, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open source projects, or sharing insights about technical communication with the developer community.
