 Welcome! This guide will teach you how to use Chimoney's API to authenticate your requests and make your own API call.

## API User Requirements

 Before you start, you need to have the following:

- **A Chimoney Developer Account:** This is where you get your API keys. Go to the [Chimoney Developer Portal](https://chimoney.io/) to get them
- **API Key:** This will give you access to the API. Remember to keep it a secret! ðŸ¤«

## API base URL

To start a request to the API, start with this base URL:

**Sandbox (for testing):**
`https://api-v2-sandbox.chimoney.io/v0.2`

**Production (for live transactions):**
`https://api-v2.chimoney.io/v0.2`

:::tip Reminder
It is best to test this request in sandbox before moving to production
